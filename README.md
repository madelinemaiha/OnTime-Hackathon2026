## Overview
In order to improve the passenger experience, my team and I developed a forecasting program that helps American Airlines passengers estimate how long it will take to get through the airport and determine their most optimal route to the gate.

## Project Description
This project focuses on Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and models the passenger journey by decomposing passenger flow into multiple subprocesses, including security screening, baggage processing, and terminal walking time.

## Key Features
- Passenger departure-time prediction model tailored to the top 5 American Airlines airports
- Decomposition of passenger flow into security, baggage, and walking subprocesses
- Time-based estimates aggregated into a total departure forecast
- Interactive web prototype for passenger-facing recommendations

## Technical Implementation
- Built a prediction model using time-based subprocess estimates
- Developed an interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype
- Translates model outputs into real-time arrival-time recommendations based on flight and terminal inputs

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Purpose
This project explores how forecasting and decomposition-based modeling can improve airport efficiency and passenger decision-making.
