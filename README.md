# OnTime – Hackathon 2026

## Overview
OnTime is a passenger forecasting tool designed to help American Airlines travelers navigate Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) efficiently. By modeling security, baggage, and walking times, the tool predicts total departure time and recommends the optimal route to the gate.  

## Features
- Predicts passenger departure times for top American Airlines airports  
- Breaks down airport journey into security, baggage, and walking subprocesses  
- Aggregates estimates into a total departure forecast  
- Interactive web prototype with real-time, passenger-facing recommendations  

## Technical Implementation
- Time-based prediction model  
- Interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype translating model outputs into actionable guidance  

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how forecasting and decomposition-based modeling can improve airport efficiency and enhance passenger decision-making, all showcased for **Hackathon 2026**.
